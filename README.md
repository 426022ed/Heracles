# Heracles
The Heracles framework for developing and evaluating text mining algorithms

Heracles is a Java software framework intended to help develop and evaluate text mining algorithms. It is the software that I use to conduct my experiments and it might be of use to other developers.

##Key features:
 * Layered structure
 * Very generic data model that should fit any text mining task
 * Wrappers for Stanford CoreNLP
 * Link to Weka toolkit for machine learning algorithms
 * Proper evaluation methods, including cross-validation, testing algorithms side-by-side, and t-tests for statistical significance
